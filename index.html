        <h1><em>Hey ashish, you have a message!</h1>
            <p>Hello Ashishi,<br>
                I want to <b>thank you</b> for being with me and not giving up after that really bad arguement that we had.
                <b>Thank you</b> for trying to understand what I meant to say because there were just so many misunderstandings
                between us at one point. <b>Thank you</b> for trusting me once again and the next time any guy does that w me,
                I'll beat tf outta him because a person like him doesn't deserve the opportunity to create an arguement
                between us. <b>Thank you</b> for not crying in front of me because I swear if I'd seen you cry, I would've ran away
                and never talked to you, that's how uncomfortable and bad it makes me feel. <b>Thank you</b> for believing in me and 
                just going through it with me and the hope that there's light at end of it. <b>THANKS A LOT</b> for sacrificing 
                your time and so much of energy for the future of us. <b>Thank you</b> for the few times when even though you didn't
                feel well, you made sure I kept smiling during those 3 days. <b>Thank you</b> ashishi for listening and bearing all 
                the hurtful shit that I said that evening, Ik it wasn't easy, and I hope u know that all of that was just in a 
                fit of rage and confusion. And I'll tell u something, u <b>haven't</b> hurt me as much as I have so don't regret anything,
                every single sentence said by u and me meant something, we didn't just say it for no reason, and every bit of it was 
                important and necessary to get us over here.<br>
            I love you so much ashish that I don't even have any words to explain that feeling to you. Everytime I'm with u, I've created memories that I can not even forget even if I lose my memory because those have been engraved on my heart.<br>
                Don't ever leave me, no matter how angry I am or just how bad the situation is, because  I swear I will regret it all my life. U mean so much to me and it really scares me to not have you in my life that is beautiful just because of u, I never 
                wanted to hurt u in anyway, i'm so sorry for everything, just forgive me for everything that u had to go through.<br>
                I LOVE YOU â™¥<br>
            P.S- im still mad at u for not eating anything.
